## Technologies Used
- Sequelize - used to model, store and retrieve data
- UIKIT - used to build a beautiful application
- Firebase Authentication - used to authentication users upon login
- Express-Handlebars - used to dynamically create the HTML on the page
- Git - version control system for tracking changes to code
- Github - to host the repository
- Heroku - to host the deployed site

## Learning Points
- Understanding how UIKIT and Handlebars work together
- Understanding how db data needs to be rendered to be read by handlebars
- Setup of models and sequalize queries to yield data from the database
- It tooks us a few days to create an MPV and just as many to tweak and iterate until we reached our final products
